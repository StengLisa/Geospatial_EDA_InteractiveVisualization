# Geo-Spatial Exploratory Data Analysis and Interactive Visualization

This project is about creating an interactive dashboard with Plotly Express and Dash based on a dataset from [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/lfst_hhacwnc/default/table?lang=en).

To start with, different steps of data pre-processing are carried out including understanding the basics of the dataset, transforming the data as well as cleaning the data in terms of handling duplications, missing values and outliers.

In what follows, the interactive dashboard is created with the objective of allowing the target audience to explore part-time employment in Europe depending on the different factors of country, time, year, sex, and age of employee.
